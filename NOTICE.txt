    This file contains C implementation of algorithms for exact addition
      and multiplication of floating-point numbers, and predicates for
      robustly performing the orientation and incircle tests used in
      computational geometry.  The algorithms and underlying theory are
      described in Jonathan Richard Shewchuk.  "Adaptive Precision Floating-
      Point Arithmetic and Fast Robust Geometric Predicates."  Technical
      Report CMU-CS-96-140, School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon
      University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, May 1996.  (Submitted to
      Discrete & Computational Geometry.)
