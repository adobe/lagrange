@brief Polygonal Discrete Differential Geometry (PolyDDG) algorithms and data structures.

This module is based on the paper "Discrete Differential Operators on Polygonal Meshes" by de Goes
et al. [1]. It provides common discrete differential operators to manipulate differential forms and
vector fields on polygonal meshes.
